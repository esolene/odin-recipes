    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Are you in a hurry to get ready for a date meal? Do you want to show off your cooking skills (of course, given that you currently don't have any at the moment with your empty lonely boy kitchen) to impress your date? This is the perfect recipe to wow your girl and make her yours! Heart and soul! (and her stomach!) This easy but elegant recipe is meant to be collaborative. So invite your date, wash your hands, and let's bring it on!</p>

    <h4>Loneliness Rating: 3/5 </h4>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>2 Ribeye steak (or really any cut of steak, preferrably not bought desparately at local Target right before the date)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Ground pepper (make sure this is whole pepper in a jar with a broken grinder)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Fresh garlic</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
      <p>*All ingredients are without measurements because as a lonely boy, you have no idea how much you should use...</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure to do steps 2-7 once BY YOURSELF at least once before your date arrives!</li>
        <li>Make sure your steaks are completely thawed. Remove them from the fridge and allow them to sit outside fridge for AT LEAST 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put a pan over medium-high heat. Season thawed steaks with a good amount of large grain salt (sea salt) and ground pepper, rub bottom of steaks with excess salt and pepper that has fallen onto table.</li>
        <li>Once pan begins to smoke drop 1-2 Tbsp of olive oil in and coat pan in it. Lay steaks away from you into pan and let sear for one minute on each side. There should be three sides you sear (top, bottom, and fat side). Render the fat throughout all the cooking.

            Note: to render fat, tilt pan up and and lean steaks against far edge of pan as you see below.</li>
        <li>Crush some fresh garlic, pinch off some fresh thyme, grab another Tbsp of olive oil and add it to pan around steaks while continuing to turn the steaks every minute.</li>
        <li>Add 2 Tbsp of butter to hot pan and baste the steaks by scooping melted butter on top of the cooking steaks.
            Pro Tip: Gordon tells you to check tenderness by equating the tenderness of your palm to rare, top of the wrist as medium, and just below that as well done. It is difficult for me to use that method, so I use cheek as rare, chin as medium, and forehead as well done.
        </li>
        <li>Continue basting and turning steaks on the minute until steak is at desired tenderness! Brush steaks with garlic. Remove from heat and place on cutting board and let rest 5-10 minutes, serve and enjoy the ultimate Gordon Ramsay Perfect Steak!</li>
    </ol>
