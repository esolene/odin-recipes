    <h4>Loneliness Rating: 2/5 </h4>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2-3 lbs. bone-in beef shank</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow or sweet onion</li>
        <li>1 small cabbage (cut into quarters)</li>
        <li>4 pcs. sweet corn (cut into 2 or 3)</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onion (cut into 2″ long)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start out by preparing your Beef Bulalo ingredients by peeling and slicing the half onion into quarters, cutting the green onion into 2″ long, and cutting the small cabbage into quarters. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To cook bulalo in the Instant Pot, pour 6 cups of water into the inside lid of the Instant Pot. Add the peppercorns, fish sauce, salt, onion, and green onions. Stir. Stirring helps ensure that the salt and fish sauce has been evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Add the bone-in beef shanks then close the lid. Put the steam release handle (located on top of the lid on the Instant Pot) to the “SEALING” position.</li>
        <li>Start cooking by pressing “SOUP” then adjust to normal and set to 45 minutes. I’ve tried cooking bulalo in the Instant Pot for 30 minutes and I find the beef shank to still be a little hard so I’ve increased it to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using frozen corn for Bulalo Instant Pot, thaw it out now then split it into thirds once thawed. See notes on ingredients, I prefer using fresh corn for bulalo, it is more flavorful./li>
        <li>Once the beef bulalo is done cooking, release the steam from the Instant Pot by turning the steam release handle from “SEALING” to “VENTING”. Once done, open the lid then transfer the beef shank, onion, and green onion into a serving dish leaving the soup in the Instant Pot.</li>
        <li>We now move to the second part which is cooking the corn and vegetable. Place the corn and cabbage in the Instant Pot with the soup then close the lid, move handle to “SEALING”, then press “MANUAL” and set it to 1 minute to cook the corn and the cabbage.</li>
        <li>Once done, release the steam again by turning from “SEALING” to “VENTING” before opening the lid.</li>
        <li>Transfer everything to the serving dish or leave it in the pot if you’re not serving it yet. It is best to keep the soup piping hot when serving.</li>
    </ol>
